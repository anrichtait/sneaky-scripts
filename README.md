# Scripts and their descriptions:

## readmeGeny:
Make your ALX projects more professional with a formatted README.md. This script 
generates a README.md after asking the user for the number of questions. It gets
it's basic format from the template.md file.

## trashcan:
This script takes over the rm command to make deleting files safer, too many times
have i deleted huge files or folders due to reckless rm -rfs. **NO LONGER I say!**
